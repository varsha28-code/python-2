A subsequence means:
The characters of s appear in t in the same order,
but not necessarily next to each other.

class Solution(object):
    def isSubsequence(self, s, t):
        i = 0
        for char in t:
            if i < len(s) and s[i] == char:
                i += 1
        return i == len(s)
